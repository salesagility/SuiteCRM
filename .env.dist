# This is a template dotenv file. You should copy it and then modify it to fit
# your setup. These environment variables won't do anything unless copied into
# a file called `.env.test`. There, they'll be used to determine information
# about the test environment.
#
# This is useful because we want the test environment to have a different
# configuration from the development environment. That way, we can run
# the automated test suites without worrying about their impact on the database
# we use for development.
#
# For more information, see the Automated Testing Documentation.
