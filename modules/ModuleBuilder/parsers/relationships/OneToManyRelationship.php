/*
 * Class to manage the metadata for a One-To-Many Relationship
 * The One-To-Many relationships created by this class are a combination of a subpanel and a custom relate field
 * The LHS (One) module will receive a new subpanel for the RHS module. The subpanel gets its data ('get_subpanel_data') from a link field that references a new Relationship
 * The RHS (Many) module will receive a new relate field to point back to the LHS
 * 
 * OOB modules implement One-To-Many relationships as:
 * 
 * On the LHS (One) side:
 * A Relationship of type one-to-many in the rhs modules vardefs.php
 * A link field in the same vardefs.php with 'relationship'= the relationship name and 'source'='non-db'
 * A subpanel which gets its data (get_subpanel_data) from the link field
 * 
 * On the RHS (Many) side:
 * A Relate field in the vardefs, formatted as in this example, which references a link field:
 * 'name' => 'account_name',
 * 'rname' => 'name',
 * 'id_name' => 'account_id',
 * 'vname' => 'LBL_ACCOUNT_NAME',
 * 'join_name'=>'accounts',
 * 'type' => 'relate',
 * 'link' => 'accounts',
 * 'table' => 'accounts',
 * 'module' => 'Accounts',
 * 'source' => 'non-db'
 * A link field which references the shared Relationship
